# Pong

I'm starting at the very beginning with my game development journey. It's time
for an old classic: **pong**.

## TODO

- [ ] Draw the score on the screen (issues finding a text rendering library that I can compile)
- [ ] Background music
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Different ball speeds
- [ ] Randomize ball direction
- [ ] Multiplayer(!)

## Disclaimer

Be warned that there will be some terrible C code here. This is my first step
into the realm of C and game programming.

That being said, I'm trying to organize the code the best I can.
